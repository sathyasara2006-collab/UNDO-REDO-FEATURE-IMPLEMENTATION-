# UNDO-REDO-FEATURE-IMPLEMENTATION-
The Undo–Redo Feature Implementation allows users to reverse or reapply their recent actions in an application. It works by storing user operations in a stack-based structure, enabling easy navigation through previous and next states. This feature improves usability, prevents mistakes, and enhances overall user experience.
